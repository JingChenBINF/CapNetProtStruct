<br />
Protein secondary structure is the first step towards prediction of protein tertiary structure, which is essential in protein structure and function. There are mainly three types of seconary structures: α-helix, β-strand and coil.  
### Capsule networks
Capsule networks is a kind of new nueral networks, which imporve the shortahe of convolutional neural networks.
## Goal

To imporve protein secondary structure prediction accuracy. (Highest accuracy now: ~84%)
